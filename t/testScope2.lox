// result:

// global
// block

// should be

// global
// global

// because a closure should capture the scope in effect at definition time
// but our closures capture only a pointer to the environment, and the
// environment is mutable. the environment in which showA is declared gets
// augmented with a new binding of a. The second call to showA finds that
// new inner a binding rather than continuing up the environment chain to
// find the outer global a.
